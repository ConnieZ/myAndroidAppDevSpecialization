# myAndroidAppDevSpecialization
This repo is for assignments as part of Android App Development Specialization by Vanderbilt University on coursera.org

See course info below, along with the repo where all of the assignment code was downloaded from.

I didn't feel right about sharing all the code for the assignments, because I didn't write it, but I'm sharing my solutions to the assignments here, as part of my work in Java for Android, specifically while doing #100DaysOfCode Challenge in 2017.
